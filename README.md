# Ski-Resort - iOS app


This project was just an idea I was playing around with. 
The goal is to help users to easily find ski resorts that fit what they are looking for. 
Users make selections, such as maximum price per ticket, and whether or not there is a terrain park. After doing so, users would then get a list of all ski resorts that fit those filters. 

This app is written in Swift, along with SwiftUI
